Miranda Plaster: Data Contribution, Mathematica Coding
Data-
equation used: d=mλ*(x/y)
Fringe (m) = {1, 2, 3, 4}
λ = 0.65um (650nm)
x = 100cm
distance (y) = {1.5cm, 2.5cm, 3.8cm, 4.8cm} 
diameter = {43.33um, 52um, 51.3um, 54.16um} 
Average diameter= 50.2um

Nick Sitter: Python Coding
Kayla Tumbaga: Data Contribution, contrasting the three data analysis languages
Gavin Yoesting:Constrasting between data analysis languages

#Gavin's Division of Labor
I have submitted my diffraction lab data to be analyzed by the three program: R, Mathematica, and Python. Once each program has a running code, I will be contrasting the data analysis languages. I will also be comparing how accessible and user friendly each program is with the given data.
