   Goal: To write three programs inorder to analyze the data from a pending experiment, using R, Python and Mathematica. Then, contrast the three languages for data analysis.
   
   Resources: Exploring Diffraction; General Chemistry Experiment 
   
   Data: 
          Equation being used is d = m(wavelength)*(x/y)
        Where y= 1.5cm, 2.5cm, 3.8cm, and 4.8cm; wavelength = 650nm; x = 100 cm.

   Data 2:
Fringe (m) = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Î» = 0.65um (650nm)
x = 100cm
distance (y) = {1.5cm, 2.5cm, 3.8cm, 4.8cm} 
diameter = {43.33um, 52um, 51.3um, 54.16um} 
Average diameter= 50.2um

# Other things to consider
  Per email, we should gather more data and then use our programs to analyze things from the data like averages or ranges
  Alexis will be on the look out for a laser pointer to run the experiment using family members as subjects, adding about 6 more sets of data to work with. In the meantime we can continue working on our codes to eventually run and analyze the data and eventually the codes themselves. 
  
  Also see division of labor for further breakdown of responsibilities.
