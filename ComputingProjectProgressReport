   Goal: To write three programs inorder to analyze the data from a pending experiment, using R, Python and Mathematica. Then, contrast the three languages for data analysis.
   
   Resources: Exploring Diffraction; General Chemistry Experiment 
   
   Data: 
          Equation being used is d = m(wavelength)*(x/y)
        Where y= 1.5cm, 2.5cm, 3.8cm, and 4.8cm; wavelength = 650nm; x = 100 cm.
